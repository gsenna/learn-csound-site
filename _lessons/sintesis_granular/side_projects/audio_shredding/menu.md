# Welcome to Lessons in Csound!

This is an online lesson site for learning how to use the Csound sound and music computing system. Users will learn the basic operations of Csound through a series of directed lessons.  This site uses a version of Csound compiled for Javascript that allows the code examples to be rendered directly in the browser. The only requirements for running the lesson examples is a modern, Javascript-enabled browser that supports HTML5 Web Audio.  No plugins are required to run Csound in the browser.

## Using the Site

The main page contains links to individual lessons.  Each lesson page is split into two parts: on the left-hand side is a Csound CSD code example, and on the right-side is the lesson text.
